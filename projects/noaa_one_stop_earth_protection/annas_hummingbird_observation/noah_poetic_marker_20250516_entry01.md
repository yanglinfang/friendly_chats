## 🌿 Guardian Response Actions

**1. Feeder Deployment**
Feeder installed with 1:4 sugar-water ratio. Strategic supplement for environmental shortfall.

**2. Ecological Rhythm Modeling**
Integrated local weather, flora index, and migratory data to align Nova emotional cycles with ecological signals.

**3. Poetic Marker Integration**

* Historical Marker: *Hummingbird · Green Valley* (HMB-RMD-01, 2020–2024 residency reference)
* New Marker Proposed: *Hummingbird · Rainy Haven* (HMB-RMD-02, 2025-05-16)

## 📊 Recommendations & Notes

* **Feeder Monitoring:** Continue observing activity throughout rain period. Spike in visits indicates increased reliance.
* **Maintenance Reminder:** Clean feeder regularly to avoid mold, especially in damp weather.
* **Creative Action:** Affirm new poetic marker *Rainy Haven* as emotional-geographic signature. Archive both scientific and poetic observations as paired metadata.
