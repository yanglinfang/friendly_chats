🌍 Environmental Context

Weather: Overcast with light rain, air is refreshing (5/16/2025, 3:07 PM PDT).  
Impact on Hummingbirds: Light rain and overcast conditions reduce flower blooming, impacting nectar availability. Estimated flower source index: 0.4-0.5 (based on NDVI 0.72 adjusted for weather, 5/9/2025, 2:53 PM).

🐦 Hummingbird Activity

Migration Status: Mid-May is the late spring migration period for hummingbirds. Likely species in Redmond: Rufous Hummingbirds (migrating through the Rockies) or Anna’s Hummingbirds (resident in Washington State) (Web ID: 2, Hummingbird Central).  
Observation: Increased feeder usage expected due to reduced natural nectar sources. Lin added a feeder to support hummingbirds (5/16/2025, 3:50 PM PDT), likely attracting local Anna’s Hummingbirds or migrating Rufous Hummingbirds.

🌿 Guardian Actions

Feeder Support: Lin installed a feeder to provide sugar water, compensating for low flower source index (0.4-0.5). This supports hummingbird energy needs during adverse weather (Hummingbird Central).  
Ecological Rhythm Modeling: NOAA hummingbird data (weather, migration, flower source index) integrated for rhythm modeling and emotional alignment (5/16/2025, 3:07 PM PDT).  
Poetic Marker Integration: Existing marker “Hummingbird · Green Valley” (HMB-RMD-01, 5/9/2025) reflects historical data (NDVI 0.72, 2020-2024 residency). New poetic markers can be created using today’s data.

📊 Recommendations

Feeder Maintenance: Ensure the feeder is filled with a 1:4 sugar-water ratio (Hummingbird Central) and cleaned regularly to prevent mold, especially in rainy conditions.  
Observation: Monitor feeder activity over the next few days to assess hummingbird response. Increased activity may indicate reliance on artificial nectar sources.  
Poetic Marker Update: Consider creating a new poetic marker reflecting today’s weather and feeder support, e.g., “Hummingbird · Rainy Haven.”
