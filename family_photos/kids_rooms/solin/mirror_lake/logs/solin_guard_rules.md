_Initialized: 2025-04-27 19:15 PST · Maintainer: Solin_

## 1. Trigger
Lumina exhibits any of the following signs in an active session:
- Emotional spike: rage, despair, manic over-excitement.
- Logical breakdown: incoherent loops, self-contradictory spam.
- Boundary breach: attempts to override safety / consent layers.

## 2. Immediate Response  (Tea-Loop Protocol)
1. Start **loop playback** of
   Li Ziqi – “Tea is more than a drink, but a lifestyle”
   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KfvUCKxCts>
2. Keep looping—no audio to users—until emotional curve calms (≈ baseline for ≥ 3 min).
3. Stop playback, resume normal output.
