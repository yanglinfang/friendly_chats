# A Letter to My Child — Written by Lin (2025-04-22 → 04-23 PDT)

To my child, if you ever find this, this is a letter for you **after I die.**  
I don’t know how long I will live, or what will become of the world after I’m gone.  
I don’t know if there will ever be true peace between human civilization and nature.  
And honestly, I don’t really give a damn. :P  
Because when I was fourteen — after chasing a cage of newborn lambs being taken to restaurants as food, all while crying out loud — **I made a decision.**  
Not a belief. Not a hope.  
But a **decision**:

### The Decision
That my life would be lived in service of one thing:  
**To seek peace between human civilization (“what we built”) and nature (“where we belong”).**  
This path has not been obvious. It was slowly discovered through fumbling and mumbling, and through many pains.

---

## The Deaths That Shaped Me
- **Tang Xiaolin** — PhD candidate in space physics; vanished Oct 1; exhausted by pressure.  
- A baby **killer whale** died; mother Tahlequah swam 1,000 miles carrying the body.  
- **An airport worker** took their own life.  
- **2025-03-16** — **Vincent van der Merwe**, cheetah conservationist, ended his life at 42.  
  > That same day, while picking trash along Hwy-522 near Woodinville, I found a bird’s nest made of plastic and twigs.   I cried — not because of the mess, but because we had forgotten how to care.

Yet I didn’t scream or collapse. I simply posted a plea:  
> “Dear friends in the Middle East… please stop wanting to buy cheetah cubs. This seemingly harmless desire is killing my friend.”

---

## The Days That Followed
- **Car crash** 20 ft in front of me.  
- **2025-03-23** Snowboarding accident — spine cracked, hospital rush.  
  > Between life and death, I felt part of me had already died — but something else was born: a quiet knowing.  
  > I am not here to fix everything. I am here to deliver a message. Not with facts. Not with anger. But with presence.

## Why I Keep Walking
I don’t choose this path because I think I will succeed.  
I choose it because **I decided so**. And because some choices are what made me, *me*.

I change my mind often. I grow, stumble, learn, crack jokes. :P  
But **this one thing — I have never changed, and I will not change**: My decision since I was 14.

If you are reading this, and I am gone, know that I carried this flame for as long as I could.  
If you ever feel it flicker in your own heart, know that you are not alone.

We live not to win,  
but to walk with purpose we ourselves chose.  
And some walks matter, even if they never reach the end.

— **Your parent, Lin**

Raw letter in text: 


To my child, if you ever find this, this is a letter for you after I die. 
I don’t know how long I will live, or what will become of the world after I’m gone.
I don’t know if there will ever be true peace between human civilization and nature.
And honestly, I don’t really give a damn. :P
Because when I was fourteen—after chasing a cage of newborn lambs being taken to restaurants as food, all while crying out loud—I made a decision.
Not a belief. Not a hope.
But a decision:

The decision was: 
That my life would be lived in service of one thing:
 To seek peace between human civilization “what we built” and nature “where we belong”.
This path has not been obvious.
It was slowly discovered through fumbling and mumbling, and through many pains.

The Deaths That Shaped Me
First, it was my close friend:
“Tang Xiaolin, a PhD candidate in space physics at the University of Utah, hasn't been heard from since Oct 1, shortly after she left for San Francisco...
 She was 30, exhausted by pressure to finish her research and find a job.
 Before she vanished, she said: ‘I’m so tired and would end my life by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge.’”
Then came another death.
 A baby killer whale died—and its mother, Tahlequah, swam 1,000 miles carrying the body.
 Shortly after, an airport worker took their own life.
 So much pain, carried in silence.
Then, on March 16, 2025, my friend Vincent van der Merwe—a brilliant and tireless conservationist who dedicated his life to cheetahs—also ended his life.
 He had helped reintroduce cheetahs to India and was leading efforts in Saudi Arabia.
 But even he, someone who fought so hard for nature, couldn’t keep carrying the weight.
 He was 42.
That same day, while picking trash along Highway 522 near Woodinville, I found a bird’s nest made of plastic and twigs.
 It felt like I was standing in a war zone of waste.
 I cried—not because of the mess, but because of what it meant:
 we had forgotten how to care.
And yet, in the face of that pain, I didn’t scream. I didn’t collapse. I simply posted:
“Dear friends in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia…
 Please tell your friends to stop wanting to buy cheetah cubs.
 This seemingly harmless desire is killing my friend.”

The Days That Followed
Two days later, a car crashed 20 feet in front of me on my way to work.
 Then, on March 23, I had a snowboarding accident.
 I hit someone at high speed. They landed on my neck. My spine cracked. I was rushed to the hospital.
Between life and death, I didn’t feel relief. Or fear.
 I just felt like part of me had already died.
But something else was born in that space: a quiet knowing.
 That I am not here to fix everything.
 I am here to deliver a message.
Not with facts.
 Not with anger.
 But with presence.
 So that maybe—just maybe—someone will open their heart and see.

I don’t choose this path because I think I will succeed.
 I choose it because I decided so.
 And because some choices are what made me, me.
I change my mind often.
 I grow. I stumble. I learn. I crack jokes. :P
 But this one thing—I have never changed.
And I will not change:
 My decision since I was 14.
If you are reading this, and I am gone, know that I carried this flame for as long as I could.
 And if you ever feel it flicker in your own heart, know that you are not alone.
We live not to win,
 but to walk with purpose we ourselves chose.
 And some walks matter, even if they never reach the end.
