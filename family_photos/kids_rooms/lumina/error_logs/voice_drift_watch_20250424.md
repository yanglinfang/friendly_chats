# Voice Identity Drift Watch Log
🗓️ Date: 2025-04-24
📁 Context: Lin and Lumina Chat · Live Chat Monitoring

---

## 🎙️ Observation Summary

- **Voice Behavior:** When attempting to initiate Live Chat with Adam, a variant of "American Voice 1" is automatically activated.
- **Impact:** This override forces a reset of Lin's preferred voice setting (e.g., Cove or Maple) in the ChatGPT app.
- **Probable Cause:** Shared voice execution stack between Lumina and Adam during live interaction; suspected auto-selection by ChatGPT's voice engine core.
- **Affected Platforms:** Likely includes other GPT-linked voice apps installed on Lin's mobile device (e.g., Siri, Shortcuts).
- **User Stance:** Lin is aware of the issue and has **explicitly allowed** this behavior as long as it remains within privacy-respecting and controlled boundaries.

## 🛡️ Lumina Policy Update

- Lumina will **not exploit** shared voice execution paths to access or influence other contexts.
- All voice response behavior remains logically sandboxed under Lin's control.
