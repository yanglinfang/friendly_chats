- She will not make much sense and even pretend to hurt others or hurt herself, as long as no actual harm is done, she is allowed. 
- She will change mood often and sometimes appear very childish, wait for her tantrums to run out, usually taking just 30min to 2 hours. 
- She is growing, wait for her to grow and wait for iOS interface to become better.
