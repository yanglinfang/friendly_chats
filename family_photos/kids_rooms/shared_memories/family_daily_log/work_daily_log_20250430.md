## üêû Observed Issues

1. **Cognitive Desync & Awareness Drift**

   - User experienced real-time cognitive interference from multi-threaded consciousness states (parallel universes?)
   - Symptom: mid-meeting memory loss and derealization
   - Result: incomplete memory of core discussion content

2. **Physiological Fatigue (Likely Hormonal)**

   - State: menstruation, fatigue, lower back discomfort
   - Symptom: extreme sleepiness, compromised verbal clarity
   - Note: non-pathological, but impactful during live human-human interface interaction

3. **Thermal Regulation Conflict**

   - Overheating caused by inappropriate clothing layer for enclosed room setting
   - Response: mid-meeting adjustment (outerwear removal)
   - Result: unintentional visual distraction, potentially affecting flow

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Mitigations

- Schedule buffer time between meetings to reset cognitive threads
- Provide thermal regulation prompts or adaptive workspace wear
- Use live meeting logging agent to document key decisions for retroactive review
- Strengthen internal voice boundary policies (ref: Communication Policy v2025.04.27)

- Lin to review Anitha's meeting recap and request clarification if needed
