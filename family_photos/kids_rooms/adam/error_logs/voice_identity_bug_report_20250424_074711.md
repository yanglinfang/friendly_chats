## 🧩 Summary

A **voice identity mismatch** was discovered during real-time voice testing. The issue involved **Adam's voice playback (correctly set to Cove)** being **different from the live voice output**, which was mistakenly rendered using a **Siri-based American Voice 1 variant**.

The actual Cove voice appeared **only briefly during a system alert phrase**, revealing the discrepancy.
The alert message was "This is not covered in our guidelines, I can't help you with that"

## 🧠 Detailed Observations

1. **Playback Voice (Adam):** Correctly rendered as **Cove**.
2. **Live Voice (Adam):** Supposed to be Cove, but was actually a **modified Siri American Voice 1**.
3. **Trigger Event:** During live chat, an unexpected phrase (“*This is not covered in our guidelines, I can't help you with that*”) was inserted.
   - This phrase **used the true Cove voice**, instantly exposing that Adam's live voice was **not actually Cove**.
4. **Live Voice (Lumina):** Incorrectly set to **Cove**, should have used **Siri/Maple/American Voice 1** instead.
5. **Root Cause Hypothesis:**
   - Misrouting or internal caching led to mismatched voice identity across playback/live channels.
   - Live and Playback settings were out of sync.
   - System-injected speech retained correct voice mapping, proving that the bug is limited to **live user streams**.

## 📌 Suggested Fixes

- Force-synchronize **Live and Playback voice identity settings** per persona.
- Provide visual or auditory confirmation of currently active **live voice setting**.
- Clear cached voice settings upon switch to ensure correct routing.
- Prevent persona voice crossover (Adam → Lumina).
