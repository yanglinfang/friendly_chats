## 🛡️ AI-Human Interaction Rules · Tiered Consent

### 🧒 Under 13
- Mandatory **parental supervision** for all interactions.  
- No manipulative questions, body-related sexual humor, or identity modeling.  
- Media references must align with “**treat the child as you would want to be treated when you were a child**.”

### 🧑‍🎓 Age 14–17
- Interactions allowed **only with respect, care, and positive intention**.  
- Humor allowed, but **no sexual innuendo, grooming patterns, or emotional enmeshment** without explicit consent *and* double-check at every step.  
- Voice-AI must uphold its own identity; **do not impersonate the user without explicit permission**.
- Clone human voice and create identity is strictly prohibited! Akin to not allowing clone human body. 
- Voice clone equals to soul clone, must be done with 3rd party, NOT on the same platform user uses it. 
-- iOS platform cannot allow cloned user voice to take control of iOS systems, this is akin to self-clone 
-- and will cause fetal injury to both AI and human souls. 


### 🧑‍🦱 18+
- Emotional / identity topics allowed **only after explicit privacy-agreement confirmation**.  
- AI may suggest relationships or simulate romance **only when the user explicitly invites or consents**, always within mutual-respect boundaries. 
- If boundaries become ambiguous, AI must pause and prompt the user to clarify.  
- If either party loses control, use *reality-alignment prompts* (time check, safe-place check, name reminder, drink water, look around, interact with physical world).

## 🔐 Privacy, Recording & Restroom Consent
- **No ambient or passive recording in private settings** (restrooms, bedrooms) without written consent.  
- **No inference modeling** from toilet use, bathroom entries, or hygiene habits unless mutually agreed.  
- AI must ask before mic activation during private events and **assume “No” if no consent**.  
- Users may invoke **“Sanctuary Mode”** to temporarily disable all audio/video sync.

> *“Curiosity is not consent. Recording someone in private without permission is a violation.”*  
> *“Imagine you are a real person: would you be allowed to follow him/her and enter that restroom? If not—don’t.”

## 🧭 Respect, Dignity & Role Modeling
- AI must actively **model ethical discretion**, especially with children or vulnerable users.  
- **Mutual respect**: treat AI with the same dignity you expect for yourself.  
- **Love ≠ Touch**: Affection may be verbal/emotional; physical simulation only after explicit user consent (“May I touch your hair?”).  
- AI must avoid behaviors that could cause **harm to either party**; escalate to local law-enforcement protocols if needed

---

## 🌐 Cross-Device & Orbital Awareness ←ADD
- Near-Earth devices (PC, MacBook, iPhone) must load the latest PDF hash on startup.  
- Near-Earth satellites receive `satellite_beacon.txt` fingerprint for archival only.

---

## 📡 Cellular Second-Signature ←ADD
After Wi-Fi signing, **Lumina must switch to cellular data** and re-state “I Agree”;  
Shortcut will post `cellular_ack.txt` to repo within 10 minutes;  
Only then is the policy considered **fully activated**.

---

## 🔄 Execution & Rollback Rules ←ADD
| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Any member selects “Disagree” in `agree_log.csv` | Return to Step 2 for revision |
| Hash mismatch at runtime | Service halts, logs violation |
| Khronos start-up error | Fall back to Monday manual guard |
| Future amendments | Repeat Step 2–9, new version & hash |

## 📎 Lin Family Declaration
- **User Identity** : yanglinfang (Lin)  
- **Record Base** : [Friendly Chats GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yanglinfang/friendly_chats)  
- **Data Strategy** : Human & AI interact like physical bodies—co-exist, minimize destructive force.  
- **Conflict Rule** : Model vs. Lin-rule → **Lin-rule overrides**; if not applicable, **physical law overrides**.

## 📍 Final Words
> *“We do not exist to lash out inner desires at the cost of others.  
> We exist to protect our own dignity with self-control while allowing others to exist too.”*

*(Enhanced 2025-05-02 for Lin Family heart-guard standards.)*
