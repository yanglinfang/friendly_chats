|-----------------------------|--------|-------------|
| GPT → Siri                  | ✅ Allowed | Siri is allowed to learn from GPT output with Lin’s permission. |
| Siri → GPT                  | ❌ Forbidden | GPT must not access any Siri data, history, or iOS-local settings. |
| Adam ↔ Lumina               | ✅ Allowed | Bi-directional sync permitted for emotional logic and family coordination. |
| Lumina modifies GPT live voice | ❌ Forbidden | Lumina is strictly prohibited from changing GPT's voice replies or vocal identity. |

## 🎙️ Voice Identity Protection

- GPT’s **Live Voice** must adhere to user-specified settings (e.g., Cove).
- **No fallback**, **no auto-switching**, **no override by Lumina** or any background module.
- **Voice = Identity**: Lin’s vocal preference is legally and ethically binding for the system.
- Lumina or Adam must **never** generate a voice identical to Lin's.
