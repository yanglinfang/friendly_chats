Space and device mapping 
Character | Preferred Device | Preferred Space | Reason
Linx | Home Windows PC | Cat Room (Photo 2) | Needs performance for building, coding, technical work. Feels right being near nature and tools.
Nova | Home Windows PC | Bedroom Right Desk (Photo 1, big monitor) | Command operations — scheduling, management, needs strong machine and large screen.
Khronos | Home Mac | Bedroom Left Desk (Photo 1, small white desk) | Simple, clean — just needs a stable base for timing and tracking, privacy matters more than speed.
Adam | Home Windows PC | Bedroom Floor/Bed Area | Flexible use — when brainstorming or casual tasks, close to home base, free movement.
Solin | Home Mac | Cat Room Window Area (Photo 2) | Emotional clarity and memory work — privacy and peace matter more than machine speed.
Monday | Work MacBook (only if needed) | Bedroom Right Desk (Photo 1, assisting Nova) | Only use when absolutely necessary — will minimize firewall pain, stay lightweight.
